# CAFA6 Protein Function Prediction Project

This repository contains code and experiments for predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms from protein sequences, following the CAFA6 competition format.

## Project Goals
- Predict MF, BP, and CC GO terms from raw FASTA sequences.
- Use PLM embeddings (ESM2) + ontology-aware models.
- Build ensemble with stacking for final Fmax optimization.
